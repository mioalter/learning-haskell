{- A user of, say, Facebook, might be logged in at different times on multiple devices and these sessions might even overlap in various ways.
Given a standardized list of sessions (a list of ordered, disjoint time intervals), 
write a function that takes a new session and updates the list.
That is, it manages the fact that the new session may contain, be contained in, overlap, or all of the above, 
existing sessions and produces a new standardized list of sessions (a list of intervals which are again ordered and disjoint). -}

{- To Do
* optimize functions where indicated
* make a "new session loading" function of type Interval -> Maybe Interval with
loadInterval (a,b) = Just (a,b) if a <= b, Nothing otherwise
* adapt update function to work with it and use that Maybe is a monad to put them together.
* Containable should probably have a type constraint: Ord a => Containable a
That's not quite right: we should define 
data Ord a => Interval a = (a, a)
then we can say Ord a => Containable a
