{- A user might be logged in at different times on multiple devices and these sessions might even overlap in various ways.
Given a list of standardized sessions (ordered, disjoint time intervals), write a function that takes a new session and updates the list.
That is, manages the fact the new session may contain, be contained in, overlap or all of the above, existing sessions and updates the list
of sessions to produce a list of ordered disjoint time intervals. -}

{- To Do
* optimize functions where indicated
* make a "new session loading" function of type Interval -> Maybe Interval with
loadInterval (a,b) = Just (a,b) if a <= b, Nothing otherwise
* adapt update function to work with it and use that Maybe is a monad to put them together.
* Containable should probably have a type constraint: Ord a => Containable a

{- 

note: we could make Interval a functor Ord a => Interval a = (a, a)
we really also should check that the endpoint is >= starting point and use Maybe
so we'd write a "load new interval" function :: (Int, Int) -> Maybe Interval that returns Nothing if end < start and Just (start, end) otherwise.
