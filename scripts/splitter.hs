{-

Given a TSV of data with one column (the last) whose values are 'train' and 'test'
write a script to split the file in two.


to list installed packages
mioss-mbp-3:scripts mio6si$ ghc-pkg list
so we have the cmdargs package

Note: using foldr preserves the order of the lines in the input file
whereas using foldl reverses them BUT foldr will build up a thunk
the size of the input file while foldl will process as it goes
(foldl is tail-recursive) so foldl is actually what you want to use

(note that the arguments to the folding functions for foldr and foldl
are reversed: for foldl, the accumulator comes first)
