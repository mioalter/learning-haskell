I decided for fun to work through the fantastic Introduction to Haskell course, previously 

http://www.seas.upenn.edu/~cis194/

taught by Brent Yorgey at UPenn. That site has been updated, but all the course material is in the folder here lectures_and_assignments here. These are my solutions to the homework assignments.
